# PathProwess
Pathfinding visualization and analysis tool to demonstrate how different search algorithms work.

Created as the main part of my University thesis.

The application represents a useful and functional tool that can be used to facilitate the detailed study and analysis of pathfinding algorithms by visualizing them in a 2D grid environment.

# Algorithms

- A*
- Dijkstra
- Greedy Best-First-Search
- Breadth-First-Search
- Depth-First-Search

# Tools
To develop the application and its interface, the following resources were used: 
- PyCharm
- Python, along with its libraries:
  - Pygame
  - Pygame GUI
  - Matplotlib
  
# Functionality showcase
